# PauseBoard: A Haptic Keyboard for Unintrusively Encouraging Regular Typing Breaks
### ⌨️ COMSM0009 Interactive Devices Project

Maintaining positive digital well-being has become essential as we spend more and more time working at desks in offices, interacting with computers and typing for hours at a time. In this paper we present PauseBoard: a computer keyboard designed to unintrusively encourage users to take regular breaks. Through the use of motorised linear potentiometers, the force required to activate each key is gradually increased, until a maximium point, after a period of productivity. Preliminary testing shows that 75\% of users respond well to this novel gentle encouragement, being reminded to take breaks while still being able to concentrate and finish their current task.
